# JBSI-codes
Codes to calculate the jitter-based synchrony index of paired spike trains
These are both MathCad and MatLab codes to compute the JBSI synchrony index of a simultaneously recorded pair of spike trains.
See the original publication (Agmon A (2012) A novel, jitter-based method for detecting and measuring spike synchrony and quantifying temporal firing precision. Neural systems & circuits 2:5. doi:10.1186/2042-1001-2-5) for details on the algorithm.
There are two MathCad codes, one to calculate a single JBSI value based on a given synchrony window and shift, the other to calculate a matrix of JBSI values for a range of synchrony windows and shifts. The MatLab routine was written by Craig Atencio, based on the single-JBSI MathCad routine.
